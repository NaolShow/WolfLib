# Install                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                  
Here is a tutorial on how to install WolfLib on Visual Studio                                         
                                         
Reminder: You must download WolfLib.dll in the Release tab!                                         
                                         
You must launch Visual Studio and then your project.                                         
Right click on the name of your project in the right pane (default location).                                         
Then click Add> Reference> Browse> Path to WolfLib.dll (previously downloaded)                                         
                                         
So you will have WolfLib.dll in the references of your project.                                         
You can add above the code of your classes:                                         
using WolfLib;                                         
                                         
For not having to write WolfLib.Text (for example)                                         
                                         
Information: When publishing your software, the user who launches it must have WolfLib.dll in the same folder as the software!
